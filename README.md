## Installing

To get started simply type `flutter pub add updat` in your terminal.

üéâ Done, It's that simple.

## Getting Started

Integration with your app requires just a few lines of code, add the following widget wherever you want your updat widget to be:

```dart
UpdatWidget(
  currentVersion: "1.0.0",
  getLatestVersion: () async {
    // Here you should fetch the latest version. It must be semantic versioning for update detection to work properly.
    return "1.0.1";
  },
  getBinaryUrl: (latestVersion) async {
    // Here you provide the link to the binary the user should download. Make sure it is the correct one for the platform!
    return "https://github.com/latest/release/bin.exe";
  },
  // Lastly, enter your app name so we know what to call your files.
  appName: "Updat Example",
),
```

That should get you up and running in just a few seconds ‚ö°Ô∏è.

or use the `UpdatWindowManager`, and let updat handle everything on autopilot. Just place it right after your `MaterialApp`.

### Theming

![Logo](https://github.com/aguilaair/updat/blob/main/promo/banner-2.svg)

Updat is extremely easy to theme. We also use `updateChipBuilder` and `updateDialogBuilder` internally to design our widgets, so you have the same customizability we do. We provide a couple of themes to get you started.

To change the theme simply add the desired theme to the builder and you're set.

#### Chips

- `defaultChip` which is an elevatedButton that only shows when an update is available. Shown by default.
- `defaultChipWithCheckFor` which is an elevatedButton that shows under all conditions, allowing to recheck for updates.
- `defaultChipWithSilentDownload` which is an elevatedButton that only shows when an update is downloaded and ready to install.

- `flatChip` which is an textButton that only shows when an update is available
- `flatChipWithCheckFor` which is an textButton that shows under all condition, allowing to recheck for updates.
- `flatChipWithSilentDownload` which is an textButton that only shows when an update is downloaded and ready to install.

- `floatingExtendedChip` which is a compact version of the dialog, which is a bit bigger and grabs user's attention more easily.
- `floatingExtendedChipWithSilentDownload` which is a compact version of the dialog, which is a bit bigger and grabs user's attention more easily, and only shows when the update is ready to be installed.

#### Dialogs

- `defaultDialog` which is the default, M2 and M3 dialog that shows by default.

### Advanced Usage  
If you need to send additional HTTP headers when downloading a release asset, you may define your
headers by setting the `downloadReleaseHeaders` property of `UpdatGlobalOptions`, you should probably do this in the main function of your code.
```dart
UpdatGlobalOptions.downloadReleaseHeaders = {
  "Authorization": "Bearer gh_pat_1234567889abcdefghijklm",
}
```
